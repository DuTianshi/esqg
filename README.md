effective surface quasi-geostrophic (eSQG) method to reconstruct the ocean interior information

This method, expounded in Laperyre and Klein (2006), assumes that the potential vorticity (PV) anomalies in the interior upper ocean are correlated to the surface PV anomalies. This eSQG approach has been used for reconstruction of upper-ocean circulation structures.
